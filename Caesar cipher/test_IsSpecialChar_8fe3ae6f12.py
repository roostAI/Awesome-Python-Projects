"""
1. Scenario: Check special character.
   - Description: Test with a special character input. This scenario will validate business logic for checking that the function correctly identifies special characters.
   - Input: A special character like '@' from the standard ASCII printable representation.
   - Expected Result: The function should return 'True' since the '@' character lies within the special characters.

2. Scenario: Check non-special character.
   - Description: Test with a non-special character input. This scenario will help to ascertain that the function does not incorrectly classify non-special characters.
   - Input: A non-special character like 'a' from the standard ASCII printable representation.
   - Expected Result: The function should return 'False' since the 'a' character does not fit the special characters.

3. Scenario: Check with a numeric character.
   - Description: Test with a numeric input to check if the function correctly identifies numeric characters as non-special.
   - Input: A numeric character like '5'.
   - Expected Result: The function should return 'False' since numeric characters are not recognized as special characters.

4. Scenario: Check with an empty string.
   - Description: Test with an empty string to evaluate function's behavior for such potential edge case.
   - Input: An empty string ''.
   - Expected Result: The function should return 'False' because an empty string does not contain special characters.

5. Scenario: Check with a whitespace character.
   - Description: Test with a whitespace to see if it interprets it as a special character.
   - Input: A whitespace character ' '.
   - Expected Result: The function should return 'False' since whitespace character is not recognized as a special character.

6. Scenario: Check with an undefined character.
   - Description: Test with an undefined character to see if it can distinguish it as non-special.
   - Input: An undefined character like '¿'.
   - Expected Result: The function should return 'False', as undefined characters are not recognized as special characters.
   
Note: There may be the need for additional tests depending on how "special character" is defined in the context of use.
