"""
1. Scenario: Test when `element` is a special character
   - Given a string with one character
   - When the character is a special character
   - Then the function should return `True`

2. Scenario: Test when `element` is not a special character
   - Given a string with one character
   - When the character is not a special character
   - Then the function should return `False`

3. Scenario: Test when `element` is an empty string
   - Given an empty string
   - When the function is called with the empty string
   - Then the function should return `False`

4. Scenario: Test when `element` is a string with more than one character
   - Given a string with more than one character
   - When the function is called with the string
   - Then the function should return `False`

5. Scenario: Test when `element` is a special character mixed with alphanumeric characters
   - Given a string with alphanumeric characters and at least one special character
   - When the function is called with the string
   - Then the function should return `False`

6. Scenario: Test when `element` is a string with space character
   - Given a string with a space character
   - When the function is called with the string
   - Then the function should return `False`

7. Scenario: Test when `element` is a string with newline or tab characters
   - Given a string with newline or tab characters
   - When the function is called with the string
   - Then the function should return `False`

8. Scenario: Test when `element` is a string with a special character from a different language (non-ASCII)
   - Given a string with a special character from a different language
   - When the function is called with the string
   - Then the function should return `False` (assuming the function is designed to work with ASCII characters only)
