"""
Test Scenario 1: 
- Description: Validate the encryption of regular characters.
- Given: A sample text input with regular characters and an encrypt number.
- When: The "encrypt" function is invoked with these inputs.
- Then: Assert the return value rightly encrypts the regular characters per provided encrypt number.

Test Scenario 2: 
- Description: Validate the encryption of numbers. 
- Given: A sample text input with numbers and an encrypt number.
- When: The "encrypt" function is invoked with these inputs.
- Then: Assert the return value rightly encrypts the number characters per provided encrypt number.

Test Scenario 3:
- Description: Validate the encryption while retaining spaces.
- Given: A sample text input with space(s) and an encrypt number.
- When: The "encrypt" function is invoked with these inputs.
- Then: Assert the return value rightly encrypts the characters while retaining the spaces in correct place(s).

Test Scenario 4: 
- Description: Validate the retention of non alphanumeric characters during encryption.
- Given: A sample input with special(non alphanumeric) characters and an encrypt number.
- When: The "encrypt" function is invoked with these inputs.
- Then: Assert the return value rightly encrypts alphanumeric characters if any, while retaining the special characters in correct places.

Test Scenario 5:
- Description: Test with a blank string.
- Given: A blank string as the message and an encrypt number.
- When: The "encrypt" function is invoked with these inputs.
- Then: Assert the return value is a blank string as there are no characters to encrypt.

Test Scenario 6: 
- Description: Validate the encryption with varying encrypt number - negative numbers.
- Given: A sample text input and a negative encrypt number.
- When: The "encrypt" function is invoked with these inputs.
- Then: Assert the return value rightly encrypts the characters per provided encrypt number.

Test Scenario 7:
- Description: Validate the encryption with varying encrypt number - Zero.
- Given: A sample text input and zero as the encrypt number.
- When: The "encrypt" function is invoked with these inputs.
- Then: Assert the return value is the same as the given string as encrypt number is zero.

Test Scenario 8:
- Description: Validate encryption with mix of alphanumeric and special characters.
- Given: A sample text containing mix of regular characters, numbers and special characters with an encrypt number.
- When: The "encrypt" function is invoked with these inputs.
- Then: Assert the return value rightly encrypts the alphanumeric characters, retains the special characters, and spaces in their respective places.

Test Scenario 9:
- Description: Functionality of encrypt function when all character inputs are the same.
- Given: A text string where all characters are identical and an encryption number.
- When: The "encrypt" function is invoked with the given inputs.
- Then: Assert the function correctly encrypts the string according to the provided encrypt number.

Test Scenario 10:
- Description: Validate functionality with long input string to test strength and speed of encryption.
- Given: A very lengthy text string and an encryption number.
- When: The "encrypt" function is invoked with these inputs.
- Then: Assert that the function is able to encrypt the string correctly and in acceptable time frame.
