"""
Scenario 1: Test with ascending price list
- In this scenario, the function should purchase stock on the first day and sell it on the last day, since the value of the stock is continually increasing.

Scenario 2: Test with descending price list
- For this scenario, the function should not execute a buy/sell operation as the price of the stock is continuously decreasing.

Scenario 3: Test with randomly fluctuating price list
- The function should strategically buy and sell the stocks to maximize the profit. The function should buy at every local minima and sell at every local maxima.

Scenario 4: Test with constant price
- The function should not execute a buy/sell operation as the stock price remains constant through the given period.

Scenario 5: Test with a list containing a single price
- In this case, the function should return without executing any operation as there is no chance to make a profit.

Scenario 6: Test with empty price list
- The function should not crash or throw an error. Since no prices are given, no buy/sell operations should be executed.

Scenario 7: Test for a large value of n with varying prices
- This is a stress test scenario to test the performance and efficiency of the function. The function will be given a large n value and a list with widely varying prices.

Scenario 8: Price list where stocks are bought multiple times and sold on different days
- In this scenario, stocks prices are such that they need to be bought and sold multiple times to maximize profit. The function should print different buy and sell days correctly.

Scenario 9: Test with negative prices
- This test is to check the behaviour of system when price list contains negative values. As the prices cannot be negative, so function should not perform any buy or sell action.

Scenario 10: Test functionality when n is zero
- In this case, an empty list is provided to the function. The function should not perform any operations as there are no prices given.
